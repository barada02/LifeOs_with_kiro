# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LifeOS Foundation establishes the core infrastructure and basic functionality for a productivity and life management application. This phase focuses on creating the basic project setup, establishing data flow between frontend, backend, and database, and implementing simple authentication with a landing page. The foundation will support future advanced features like AI companion, health tracking, and analytics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up the basic project structure with React frontend and FastAPI backend, so that I have a solid foundation for building the LifeOS application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL have a frontend directory with React + Vite configuration
2. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL have a backend directory with FastAPI and virtual environment
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL run on a designated port and be accessible via API endpoints
4. WHEN the frontend starts THEN it SHALL run on development server and be able to make API calls
5. WHEN both services are running THEN they SHALL be able to communicate successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish database connectivity with SQLAlchemy, so that the application can persist and retrieve data reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the database THEN the system SHALL use SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM
2. WHEN initializing the database THEN the system SHALL create tables from a schema.sql file
3. WHEN the backend starts THEN it SHALL successfully connect to the database
4. WHEN testing database operations THEN the system SHALL support basic CRUD operations
5. WHEN database schema changes THEN the system SHALL provide migration capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify data flow between frontend, backend, and database, so that I can ensure the full stack is working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the connection THEN the frontend SHALL successfully call backend API endpoints
2. WHEN the backend receives requests THEN it SHALL successfully query the database and return responses
3. WHEN data is created via frontend THEN it SHALL be persisted in the database via backend API
4. WHEN data is retrieved via frontend THEN it SHALL display information from the database
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly handled and communicated between layers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a simple landing page with signup and login options, so that I can start using the LifeOS application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a clean landing page with LifeOS branding
2. WHEN a user clicks signup THEN the system SHALL display a simple registration form (username, email, password)
3. WHEN a user clicks login THEN the system SHALL display a simple login form (email, password)
4. WHEN a user submits valid registration THEN the system SHALL create an account and redirect to dashboard
5. WHEN a user submits valid login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
6. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a basic dashboard after login, so that I can see that the authentication system is working and have a foundation for future features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to a dashboard page
2. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message with their username
3. WHEN a user is on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a logout option
4. WHEN a user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear their session and redirect to landing page
5. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access dashboard THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login page
