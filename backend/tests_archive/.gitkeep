# Tests Archive

This folder contains one-time test files that were created for specific task verification and are kept for reference.

## Archived Test Files

- `test_task6_verification.py` - Comprehensive verification test for Task 6 (health check endpoint and database connectivity)
- `test_health_endpoint.py` - Detailed health endpoint testing with various scenarios
- `test_database_error_handling.py` - Database error handling verification tests
- `simple_auth_test.py` - Direct authentication functionality testing without TestClient

## Purpose

These tests were created to verify specific implementation requirements and are archived to:
1. Keep the main backend directory clean and organized
2. Preserve test code for future reference
3. Maintain a record of verification steps taken during development

## Usage

To run any archived test, navigate to the backend directory and run:
```bash
python tests_archive/[test_file_name].py
```

Note: Some tests may require adjusting import paths or starting the server manually.
